# StarBLAST

StarBLAST is a scalable extension of SequenceServer BLAST, making BLAST accessible to educators and researchers running classroom-scale searches concurrently.

StarBLAST utilizes CCTOOLS for faster, distributed computing and CyVerse’s Visual Interactive Computing Environment (VICE). For a more in depth explaination and step-by-step tutorials of the whole StarBLAST collection, visit our [documentation page](https://starblast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


#### What is SequenceServer?

SequenceServer is a front-end implementation of BLAST with improved GUI and customizable database input developed by the Wurmlab at Queen Mary University of London ([Priyam *et al.*](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/12/2922/5549819), 2019). However, it is limited scaling and may be difficult to deploy for some people. StarBLAST extends SequenceServer for easier deployment and to scale for a larger number of simultaneous users (e.g., students).
